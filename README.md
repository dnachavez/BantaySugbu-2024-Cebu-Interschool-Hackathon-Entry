## üí° Idea / Solution <a name = "idea"></a>

BantaySugbu is a crime prevention and detection app designed specifically for Cebu City. The idea behind this app is to leverage technology, specifically AI, to enhance safety and security in the city. The app aims to provide tools for crime prevention, emergency response, and community safety monitoring.

With BantaySugbu, users will have access to real-time crime history and heat map, allowing them to stay informed about incidents happening in their vicinity. The app also reports detected crime to nearest emergency response to easily notify authorities about any suspicious activities or emergencies.

By harnessing the power of AI and technology, BantaySugbu aims to create a safer and more secure environment for the residents of Cebu City. It is a comprehensive solution that addresses the need for effective crime prevention, and emergency response in the context of a smart city initiative.


## ‚õìÔ∏è Dependencies / Limitations <a name = "limitations"></a>

### Dependencies:
- Python 3.11.9 or higher
- Flask 2.3.2 or higher
- PyTorch 2.0.1 or higher
- Transformers 4.30.2 or higher
- Pillow 9.4.0 or higher
- PythonDotENV 1.0.0 or higher

### Limitations:
1. Limited Data Accuracy: The accuracy of crime data depends on the availability and reliability of reported incidents, including datasets the model has been trained on. Incomplete or inaccurate reporting can lead to discrepancies in the crime history and heat map provided by the app.

2. Network Connectivity: BantaySugbu relies on a stable internet connection to fetch real-time crime data and communicate with emergency response services. Poor network connectivity can affect the app's performance and responsiveness.

3. Privacy Concerns: BantaySugbu collects and stores data, including location information, to provide personalized crime alerts and improve the app's functionality. However, privacy concerns may arise regarding the collection and usage of data.

4. Technical Limitations: The current version of BantaySugbu may have technical limitations in terms of scalability, performance, and compatibility with different devices and operating systems. These limitations may impact the app's usability and user experience.

### Explanation:
1. The limitation of limited data accuracy exists because the app relies on reported incidents, and if incidents are not reported or inaccurately reported, it can affect the accuracy of the crime data.

2. The limitation of network connectivity exists because the app requires a stable internet connection to fetch real-time crime data and communicate with emergency response services. Poor network connectivity can hinder these functionalities.

3. The limitation of privacy concerns exists because the app collects and stores data, including location information, which may raise privacy concerns.

4. The limitation of technical limitations exists because the current version of the app may have scalability, performance, and compatibility limitations. These limitations can affect the app's usability and user experience.

### Impact and Further Research:
- The limited data accuracy can impact the reliability of crime insights and may require further research on improving incident reporting mechanisms and data verification processes.
- The network connectivity limitation highlights the need for robust offline capabilities and alternative communication channels in case of poor internet connectivity.
- The privacy concerns call for transparent data handling practices and privacy-enhancing features to address user concerns.
- The technical limitations indicate the need for continuous development and optimization to improve scalability, performance, and compatibility with different devices and operating systems.


## üöÄ Future Scope <a name = "future_scope"></a>

## üöß What We Could Not Develop During the Hackathon

During the course of the Hackathon, one aspect of our project that we were unable to develop was the SMS notification feature. This feature would have allowed the app to send alerts to the nearest emergency response team whenever a crime was detected. Unfortunately, due to limited access to an SMS API and time constraints, we were unable to implement this functionality.

## üåü Future Potential of Our Project

Looking ahead, our project has great potential for further development and expansion. With continued work and resources, we envision the following achievements:

1. **Enhanced Crime Prevention:** By leveraging AI and technology, our app can continue to improve crime prevention measures. This includes developing advanced algorithms to detect suspicious activities and provide real-time alerts.

2. **Expanded Emergency Response Integration:** In the future, we aim to integrate our app with emergency response services, enabling seamless communication and coordination between users and authorities. This would enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of emergency response efforts.

3. **Community Engagement and Collaboration:** We plan to incorporate features that promote community engagement and collaboration. This could involve creating platforms for citizens to report incidents, share safety tips, and participate in neighborhood watch programs.

4. **Data Analysis and Insights:** By analyzing crime data collected through the app, we can gain valuable insights into crime patterns and trends. This information can be used to develop targeted strategies for crime prevention and resource allocation.

5. **Partnerships and Integration:** We aspire to establish partnerships with local law enforcement agencies, government bodies, and community organizations. This collaboration would enable us to access additional resources, data, and expertise to further enhance the effectiveness of our app.

Overall, our project has the potential to make a significant impact on safety and security in Cebu City. With continuous development and support, we aim to create a comprehensive crime prevention and detection solution that contributes to building a safer and more secure environment for all residents.
